Crime data is more than numbers—it reflects real people, places, and patterns that impact everyday life.
I built this project to explore how data analytics and machine learning can uncover meaningful insights from complex, unlabeled datasets.
While developing this system, I focused not just on model accuracy, but on explainability, clarity, and usability, so insights can actually be understood and acted upon.
This project helped me strengthen my skills in problem-solving, analytics, and communicating technical results to non-technical audiences.
It represents my interest in using technology responsibly to support data-driven decision making in real-world scenarios.
